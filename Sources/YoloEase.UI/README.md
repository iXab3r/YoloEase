# TODO
- MAJOR! Use Channel<T> instead of the current system
- remove advanced mode
- ~~predict only NON labeled items~~
- ~~add an option to predict the whole pack (e.g. for testing)~~
- preserve prediction results between sessions to avoid running expensive predictions again
- for sources:
  - make it possible to disable source. NON-labeled files from disabled sources are not counted in overall calculations
  - print labeled/total files from the source
  - print prediction stats by label?
- for auto-annotation, make it possible to select confidence for different labels
- for packs generation add another strategies:
  - pick specific number of files instead of percentage
  - pick percentage of TOTAL files (e.g. no matter how many files, 5% = 20 packs)
